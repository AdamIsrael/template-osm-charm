# Actions are yaml-defined primitives that are run for Day 1 or Day 2
# operations. Each top-level key represents a primitive.
#
# To define a primitive that touches a file on the VNF, we create the example
# below, which specifies a filename to be touched. When implemented, the
# `touch` primitive will `touch` the filename, and declares that the `filename`
# parameter is required.
#
# touch:
#     description: "Touch a file on the VNF."
#     params:
#         filename:
#             description: "The name of the file to touch."
#             type: string
#             default: ""
#     required:
#         - filename
